-----TO FIX-----
A* OVERALL -> shall only use % for size in order to allow resizing (enough time ??)


-----CASUAL TESTING------
* read_current returns a [] instead of a str ? Didn't understand why tbf

-----FUNCTIONS-----
- debtbar() -> to get the person that is the creator of a trip
- calc_debt(current_user) -> for the debt pages
- get_list_friends(current_user, current_trip) -> to know who else than the current user is in the trip
- get_name_from_icon(icon)
- get_icon_from_name(name)
- DeleteTrip(...) & UpdateRoles(...) -> only used in app.all(/logged) to make it shorter

-----IMPROVMENTS-----
A* move role setting to 'friends page'
L* display a message when nothing to print in 'balance'
A* display budget in 'specific travel' with progression (123/123)
	-> budget set initially is PER MEMBER
A* display comment in 'fst-view'
L* display expense comment in 'spe travel'
L* clean all data
A* finish cleaning app.js
L* display a message on FST-VIEW if no travel to show
