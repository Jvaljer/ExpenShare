-----TO FIX-----
* must make selecting categories & members NOT MANDATORY

-----UNIMPLEMENTED VIEWS-----
* Specific Travel - Category Detail


-----VIEWS DETAIL TO FIX-----
* 'new-trip-view' : shall re-implement adding members (right/left disposition)
* 'new-trip-view' : shall re-implement adding categories (right/left disposition)
* 'fst-view' : added trips are fitting their content
* 'friends': be able to add new friends for the trip from there (If we have time/ Not a priority)
* 'sign-in-view' : must allow user to select an icon from a list by clicking
* 'add-expense': change the Add button
* 'valid-expense': change the Go back to home button


-----DATA COMMUNICATION-----
* 'travel-main-view'->'fst-view' : user information aren't well fetched (icon & username mis-displayed)
* 'profile' : missing the expense information 
* 'debt': no dynamic yet


-----OTHER-----
* Try with real 'server' stuff asap...
* modify login logic (not intuitive as it is yet)
* allow users to select their icon (list of images) when creating account
* move code from the app.js to separate js file - reorganise code (see later)
* there is nowhere where we assign the roles 


=====SOLUTION IDEAS=====
* Implement a 'previous.json' in datas to keep track of the page we are coming from
