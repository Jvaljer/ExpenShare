-----VIEWS DETAIL TO FIX-----
A* should add possibility to remove a trip from fst-view (cross button ?)


-----WALKTHROUGH #2-----
A* OVERALL shall CENTER THAT FCKING + BTN
A* OVERALL -> shall only use % for size in order to allow resizing (FCK that will be painful)
A* start cleaning APP.JS (turn for(for() into .map & .includes ?)
A* modify categories icon displaying (from category name adding .png)
A* display current role in profile (instead of 'select an item') --> for this, the creator shouldn't be able to choose a role bc he already have one

L* rename categories images to match their name -> I started
L* add a 'paid' button for debts
L* Start doing functions in app.JS

I will list all of the functions here. If they don't have an explicit name, I will put what they do.
So that you can just take a look through this list to know if you can reuse something and so that 
we don't have duplicata for later when we will rearrange the code

-----FUNCTIONS-----

- debtbar() -> to get the person that is the creator of a trip
- calc_debt(current_user) -> for the debt pages
- get_list_friends(current_user, current_trip) -> to know who else than the current user is in the trip
- get_name_from_icon(icon)
- get_icon_from_name(name)
