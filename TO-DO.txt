-----TO FIX-----
* must make selecting categories & members NOT MANDATORY

-----UNIMPLEMENTED VIEWS-----
* Specific Travel - Category Detail


-----VIEWS DETAIL TO FIX-----
* 'new-trip-view' : shall re-implement adding members (right/left disposition)
* 'new-trip-view' : shall re-implement adding categories (right/left disposition)
* 'fst-view' : added trips are fitting their content
* 'friends' : icon not displayed
* 'friends': be able to add new friends for the trip from there
* 'friends': the first one displayed should be ourself
* 'sign-in-view' : must allow user to select an icon from a list by clicking


-----DATA COMMUNICATION-----
* 'travel-main-view'->'fst-view' : user information aren't well fetched (icon & username mis-displayed)
* 'navbar'->'friends' : no information communicated
* 'navbar'->'profile' : no information communicated


-----NAVIGATION-----
* 'navbar'->"Debt" : no link yet (should have diff between admin and normal user) 
* my profile should be accessible also on the main page, through the icon on the corner, so then if you click on the arrow to go back, it should go back to the main page with all the travels. Rn, only accessible through specific trips and go back to the main page of the trip


-----OTHER-----
* Try with real 'server' stuff asap...
* modify login logic (not intuitive as it is yet)
* allow users to select their icon (list of images)


=====SOLUTION IDEAS=====
* Implement a 'previous.json' in datas to keep track of the page we are coming from
