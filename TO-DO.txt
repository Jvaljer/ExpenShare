-----TO FIX-----
A* OVERALL -> shall only use % for size in order to allow resizing (FCK that will be painful)
A* start cleaning APP.JS (turn for(for() into .map & .includes ?)

L* Start doing functions in app.JS


-----CASUAL TESTING------
* 'Done' button to pay a debt isn't working (in debt-admin)
* Category chart label isn't the one we wanna display
* read_current returns a [] instead of a str ? Didn't understand why dbf


I will list all of the functions here. If they don't have an explicit name, I will put what they do.
So that you can just take a look through this list to know if you can reuse something and so that 
we don't have duplicata for later when we will rearrange the code

-----FUNCTIONS-----
- debtbar() -> to get the person that is the creator of a trip
- calc_debt(current_user) -> for the debt pages
- get_list_friends(current_user, current_trip) -> to know who else than the current user is in the trip
- get_name_from_icon(icon)
- get_icon_from_name(name)
