-----TO FIX-----
A* OVERALL -> shall only use % for size in order to allow resizing (enough time ??)


-----CASUAL TESTING------
* read_current returns a [] instead of a str ? Didn't understand why tbf

I will list all of the functions here. If they don't have an explicit name, I will put what they do.
So that you can just take a look through this list to know if you can reuse something and so that 
we don't have duplicata for later when we will rearrange the code

-----FUNCTIONS-----
- debtbar() -> to get the person that is the creator of a trip
- calc_debt(current_user) -> for the debt pages
- get_list_friends(current_user, current_trip) -> to know who else than the current user is in the trip
- get_name_from_icon(icon)
- get_icon_from_name(name)
- DeleteTrip(...) & UpdateRoles(...) -> only used in app.all(/logged) to make it shorter

-----IMPROVMENTS-----
* move role setting to 'friends page'
* display a message when nothing to print in 'balance'
