-----TO FIX-----
A* must make selecting categories & members NOT MANDATORY


-----VIEWS DETAIL TO FIX-----
L* 'friends': be able to add new friends for the trip from there (If we have time/ Not a priority)
A* 'sign-in-view' : must allow user to select an icon from a list by clicking
A* should add possibility to remove a trip from fst-view (cross button ?)

-----DATA COMMUNICATION-----
L* 'profile': for now the expense are general but i should divide to have amount per person
L* 'debt-admin': almost dynamic yet
L* 'debt-everyone': need to fix amount per person + icon of who to pay/get it from
A* problem with the current.json, that doesn't allow to use the navigation properly


-----NAVIGATION-----

-----OTHER-----
* Try with real 'server' stuff asap... ui ui baguette
A* there is nowhere where we assign the roles (OMW)


-----WALKTHROUGH #2-----
L* /add-expense check how to input floats in amount
L* /add-expense->/specific-travel the travel-bar is not displayed
L* shall implement 'Latest Expense'

A* /fst-view shall display users icon on trip 
A* /fst-view shall only display OTHER users
A* OVERALL shall CENTER THAT FCKING + BTN
A* OVERALL -> shall only use % for size in order to allow resizing 
A* /new-trip shall augment the budget limit (5000?)
A* /add-expense->/specific-travel the chart is not displayed (CHART NEVER DISPLAYS APPART FROM ABOVE)
A* /specific-category shall add gap between user's row (SAME SHIT)
A* implement roles in Profile (list of roles)
A* /friends->/specific-travel shall fix current it is null
A* start cleaning APP.JS (functions & stuff)
