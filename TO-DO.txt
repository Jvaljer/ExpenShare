-----TO FIX-----

-----UNIMPLEMENTED VIEWS-----
* Specific Travel - Category Detail

-----VIEWS DETAIL TO FIX-----
* 'new-trip-view' : no style for added members
* 'new-trip-view' : no style for added categories
* 'fst-view' : added trips are a bit wider than basic one
* 'friends' : icon not displayed
* 'new-trip-view' : selection popup for members & categories
*

-----DATA COMMUNICATION-----
* 'valid-trip'->'fst-view' : user information aren't well fetched (icon & username mis-displayed)
* 'new-trip-view'->'fst-view' : user information aren't well fetched (icon & username mis-displayed)
* 'fst-view'->'travel-main-view' : chart is made without travel informations
* 'fst-view'->'travel-main-view' : no information communicated
* 'travel-main-view'->'fst-view' : user information aren't well fetched (icon & username mis-displayed)
* 'navbar'->'friends' : no information communicated
* 'navbar'->'profile' : no information communicated

-----NAVIGATION-----
* 'travel-main-view' : Cannot POST /new-expense
* 'navbar'->"Home" : Cannot GET /logged
* 'friends'->"BACK-BTN" : sends to "/login" with errors
* 'navbar'->"Add an Expense" : click does nothing
* 'navbar'->"Debt" : click does nothing
* 'profile'->"BACK-BTN" : sends to "/login" with errors

-----OTHER-----
* Try with real 'server' stuff asap...
* modify login logic (not intuitive as it is yet)
* allow users to select their icon (list of images)

=====SOLUTION IDEAS=====
* Implement a 'previous.json' in datas to keep track of the page we are coming from
